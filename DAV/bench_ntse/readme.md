# Benchmark Evaluation of NTSE_QA.csv using Gemma 3 4B (Ollama)

## Objective
Evaluate the NTSE_QA.csv benchmark using the Gemma 3 4B model in Ollama. The goal is to first establish a baseline accuracy using a fixed prompt and then apply various techniques to improve the model's performance while adhering to the following rules:

- Use a single pipeline across all questions.
- Experiment with different techniques such as prompting, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and LLM agents.
- Do not provide the LLM with internet access. Use Gemma3 4B only using ollma.

## **Step 1: Baseline Evaluation**

1. Load the NTSE_QA.csv dataset.
2. Use the existing prompt without modifications.
3. Evaluate the performance of Gemma 3 4B on the benchmark, measuring accuracy.
4. Record the baseline accuracy.

## **Step 2: Improving Performance**
### **Techniques to Experiment With:**

1. **Prompt Engineering**  
   - Refine the prompt to provide clearer instructions.
   - Use few-shot examples to guide the model.

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
   - Implement a retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant information from a local knowledge base before answering.

3. **LLM Agents**  
   - Introduce a reasoning agent to validate or refine answers before finalizing responses.

4. **Self-Consistency Decoding**  
   - Generate multiple responses and select the most frequent or confident answer.

5. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**  
   - Encourage step-by-step reasoning before selecting an answer.


## **Step 3: Comparing Results**

| Technique | Accuracy (%) |
|-----------|-------------|
| Baseline  | *XX.XX%*    |
| Improved (Our method) | *XX.XX%* |

Also provide reasoning on why your method worked.

## **Conclusion**
The baseline performance of Gemma 3 4B on the NTSE_QA.csv benchmark was established. Different enhancement techniques such as prompt engineering, RAG, and LLM agents were applied to increase accuracy. The best-performing technique will be selected for further refinement.
